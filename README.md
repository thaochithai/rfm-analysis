## üìä Project Overview
This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers of a UK-based online retail store that sells all-occasion gifts. By categorizing customers based on their purchasing behavior, I aim to deliver actionable insights that enable targeted marketing strategies and optimize customer engagement.

### Key Objectives:
- Segment customers based on their purchasing patterns
- Identify high-value customer groups and growth opportunities
- Provide actionable recommendations for each segment
- Optimize marketing strategy

## üíº Business Context
Understanding different customer segments allows businesses to:
- Target marketing efforts more effectively
- Develop personalized communication strategies
- Optimize resource allocation
- Increase customer retention and lifetime value

## üìã Dataset Information
- **Source:** Online retail transaction records
- **Size:** 541,909 records with 8 columns
- **Time Period:** December 2010 to December 2011
- **Fields:** Customer purchases, including invoice details, products, quantities, prices, and customer information

### Data Dictionary

|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| InvoiceNo   | Invoice number. A 6-digit code uniquely assigned to each transaction. If the code starts with 'C', it indicates a cancellation. | Object          |
| StockCode   | Product (item) code. A 5-digit code uniquely assigned to each product.      | Object          |
| Description | Product (item) name.                                                        | Object          |
| Quantity    | Quantity of each product per transaction.                                   | int64           |
| InvoiceDate | Date and time when the transaction was generated.                           | datetime64[ns]  |
| UnitPrice   | Price per unit in sterling.                                                 | float64         |
| CustomerID  | Customer number. A 5-digit code uniquely identifying each customer.         | float64         |
| Country     | Name of the country where the customer resides.                             | Object          |

## üîç Methodology
The project follows these key steps:

### 1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Explored structure, datatypes, and summary statistics
  - 1,454 missing values in `Description`
  - 135,080 missing values in `CustomerID`
  - 5,268 duplicate records

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Removed rows with missing `CustomerID`
- Removed duplicate entries
- Negative values in `Quantity` indicate cancelled orders (removed), while negative values in `UnitPrice` represent balance adjustments (removed)
- Converted `CustomerID` to integer type
- Resulted in **301,020** clean records

### 2. RFM Calculation
- **Recency:** Days since last purchase (as of December 31, 2011)
- **Frequency:** Number of unique purchases
- **Monetary:** Total customer spend

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- Scored each RFM dimension on a scale of 1 to 5
- Combined R, F, M scores into a 3-digit composite RFM score
- Mapped scores to customer segments using predefined rules:

| Segment              | RFM Score                                                                                              |

</p>

### Average Basket Size (ABS) per Segment
Average ABS across all segments is **¬£1,479.80**.
"At Risk" and "Need Attention" segments have relatively high ABS, just below the average ‚Äî these are valuable opportunities to nurture.

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

### High-Value Segments
Champions: These customers purchase frequently and recently, with the highest average monetary value.
‚Üí Strategy: Leverage this segment with premium product offerings and high Average Basket Size (ABS) SKUs. Ensure strong retention with exclusive perks or early access to new collections.

#### Loyal Customers: This group shows consistent purchasing behavior with strong potential for long-term value.
‚Üí Strategy: Maintain engagement through personalized offers, loyalty points, and feedback loops to reinforce loyalty and prevent churn.

#### At Risk: Customers here have shown moderate value but are slipping in recency. This could be due to one-off or declining purchases.
‚Üí Strategy: Re-engage with recurring promotions, personalized win-back campaigns, or reminders based on their past preferences to boost frequency and recency.

### Growth & Potential Segments
Potential Loyalists / New Customers / Promising: These segments reflect new or infrequent buyers with lower monetary contribution.

‚Üí Strategy:
 - For new buyers: Offer first-time incentives like welcome vouchers, free shipping, or starter bundles to increase basket size and conversion.
 - For potential loyalists: Introduce tiered loyalty programs, early loyalty discounts, or referral bonuses to nudge them into higher engagement and spending.

### Key Opportunity
While Champions and Loyal Customers are top-performing groups in terms of value, many segments represent large customer bases with low monetary value.
‚Üí Strategy: Focus on increasing Average Basket Size and Order Value through better cross-sell/upsell tactics, bundling offers, and value-based promotions.
